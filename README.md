This was for a course I took for 2023. Despite the name, it barely went over physics topics(it briefly went over topography) and intsead went over machine learning in a general sense. Predictions, image/data classification and accuracy testing is some of the stuff I remember. The main programing language for this course was MATLAB, which is very similar to Python in my opinion.

The textbook we used for the course was:
Steven L. Brunton, and J. Nathan Kutz, “Data-Driven Science and 
Engineering: Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control,” 2nd 
Edition, Cambridge University Press (2022)

The final was a presenation based on something we learned based on classroom material or messing around with the Matlab datasets, tools or programmining(mine was about deepfaking). 

I am keeping this around for archival purposes and also, I figured since I am going to take a course on Digital Image Processing in Fall of 2025 which will also primarily use Matlab, I can keep this here for pracice.
